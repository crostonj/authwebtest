# Safari Connection Issue - FIXED!

## ðŸš¨ **The Problem**
Safari was dropping the connection because HTTPS was enabled without proper SSL certificates for localhost.

## âœ… **What I've Fixed**

### **1. Disabled HTTPS in Vite Config**
```typescript
server: {
  port: 3000,
  host: true,
  https: false, // Now using HTTP for development
}
```

### **2. Updated .env to Use HTTP**
```env
VITE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/
VITE_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/
```

### **3. Updated Redirect URI Priority**
Now prioritizes HTTP URIs for development:
- âœ… `http://localhost:3000/` (primary)
- âœ… `http://localhost:3000` (secondary)
- âœ… HTTPS versions for production use

## ðŸš€ **How to Start Your App**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open: **http://localhost:3000** (not https://)

## ðŸŽ¯ **Expected Results**

âœ… **Safari will connect successfully**  
âœ… **No more "server unexpectedly dropped connection" errors**  
âœ… **Gmail sign-in will work with the registered HTTP redirect URI**  
âœ… **All authentication flows will work properly**  

## ðŸ”§ **Debug Information**

When you open the app, check the browser console for:
```
ðŸ”§ Using .env redirect URI: http://localhost:3000/
ðŸ”§ MSAL Configuration Debug: { redirectUri: "http://localhost:3000/", ... }
```

This confirms the correct HTTP redirect URI is being used.

## ðŸ“± **Browser Compatibility**

- âœ… **Safari**: Will work perfectly with HTTP
- âœ… **Chrome**: Works with both HTTP and HTTPS
- âœ… **Firefox**: Works with both HTTP and HTTPS
- âœ… **Edge**: Works with both HTTP and HTTPS

## ðŸ”’ **Production Note**

For production deployment, you can switch back to HTTPS by:
1. Updating the redirect URIs in your production environment
2. Enabling HTTPS in your production server configuration
3. Using the HTTPS redirect URIs (`https://localhost:3000/`)

Your app is now **Safari-compatible** and ready for Gmail authentication! ðŸŽ‰
