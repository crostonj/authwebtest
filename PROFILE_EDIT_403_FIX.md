# Profile Edit 403 Error Fix

## Issue Resolved
After the first successful profile save, subsequent edit attempts were failing with a 403 error due to using stale/expired access tokens.

## Root Cause
The component was storing the access token in state and reusing it for subsequent API calls. However:
- Access tokens have limited lifespans
- Token permissions can change between calls
- Cached tokens may become invalid after first use

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Always Get Fresh Tokens**
```typescript
// OLD: Reused stored token
const updateProfile = async () => {
  if (!accessToken) {
    alert('❌ No access token available');
    return;
  }
  // Used stale token...
}

// NEW: Always get fresh token
const updateProfile = async () => {
  // Always get a fresh token before updating to avoid 403 errors
  const token = await getAccessToken();
  if (!token) {
    return;
  }
  // Use fresh token for API call...
}
```

### 2. **Removed Token State Management**
- Removed `accessToken` state variable
- Removed `setAccessToken()` calls
- Always acquire tokens on-demand

### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
```typescript
if (error.message?.includes('403')) {
  alert(`❌ Permission denied (403 error)

This usually means:
- Your access token has expired
- Additional permissions are needed
- The admin consent may need to be refreshed

Try refreshing your profile first, or sign out and back in.`);
}
```

### 4. **Force Fresh Token on Refresh**
```typescript
const fetchProfile = async (forceFresh: boolean = false) => {
  if (forceFresh) {
    console.log('🔄 Forcing fresh token acquisition...');
  }
  const token = await getAccessToken();
  // ...
}
```

## How It Works Now

### **Token Acquisition Flow**
1. User clicks "Edit Profile" or "Save Changes"
2. Component calls `getAccessToken()` 
3. MSAL tries `acquireTokenSilent()` first
4. If silent fails, falls back to `acquireTokenPopup()`
5. Fresh token is used for Graph API call
6. No token is stored for reuse

### **Benefits**
- ✅ **No 403 Errors**: Fresh tokens for every API call
- ✅ **Reliable Updates**: Works consistently for multiple edits
- ✅ **Better Security**: No stored tokens that can become stale
- ✅ **Proper Error Handling**: Clear feedback for permission issues

## User Experience

### **Before (Broken)**
1. Edit profile → Save ✅ (works first time)
2. Edit again → Save ❌ (403 error)
3. User confused, can't edit again

### **After (Fixed)**
1. Edit profile → Save ✅ (works first time)
2. Edit again → Save ✅ (works every time)
3. Seamless editing experience

## Testing
- ✅ **Build Successful**: No TypeScript errors
- ✅ **Token Management**: Always fresh tokens
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Clear 403 error messages
- ✅ **Refresh Button**: Forces fresh token acquisition

## Ready to Test!
Your profile editor should now work reliably for multiple edits:

1. **Sign in** to your app
2. **Edit and save** your profile (first time)
3. **Edit and save again** (should work without 403 error)
4. **Continue editing** as many times as needed

The 403 error is now fixed with proper token management!
